# Application-of-ML-models-for-Early-Identification-of-Financial-Crises
A financial crisis is a state of an economy in which it experiences stagnation, if not even almost total collapse. A financial crisis is accompanied by such characteristic changes as a sharp change in the value of most financial instruments, a drop in production levels, inflation, crises in other areas, and so on. The development of all kinds of methods for early identification of financial crises, including those based on machine learning algorithms, is an extremely important research topic for mathematicians in all fields, whether in the banking sector or in national economic development planning.
